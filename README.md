# US Accidents (2016 - 2023) - Data Analysis & Insights



## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the **US Accidents (2016-2023) dataset** to uncover trends and patterns in road accidents. The goal is to analyze accident frequency, severity, and contributing factors like weather, time, and location.

## 📂 Dataset Details

- **Source**: Kaggle (US Accidents Dataset)
- **Time Period**: 2016 - 2023
- **Records**: 5 Millions of accident reports
- **Features**: Location, time, severity, weather, road conditions, etc.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **No Data for New York** 🗽 – Missing records suggest a potential data collection gap.
- **Exponential Accident Distribution** – Few cities have **extremely high accident rates**, while most have very few.
- **Less than 6% of cities** report more than **1,000 accidents annually**.
- **Weather & Time Impact** – Peak accident times align with **rush hours**, and adverse weather conditions increase accident severity.

## 📊 Visualizations & Insights

- **Heatmaps** showing accident hotspots 🗺️
- **Time-series analysis** of accident trends ⏳
- **Severity distribution** based on location and weather 🌧️

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
- **Data Visualization**

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Run the Notebook

Open **Google Colab** or Jupyter Notebook and run `US Accidents.ipynb`.

## 📌 Next Steps

✅ Perform **predictive modeling** for accident risk forecasting.\
✅ Explore **external datasets** to supplement missing information (e.g., NY accidents).\
✅ Optimize **data cleaning & preprocessing** for deeper insights.
